     The request has succeeded. The information returned with the response is dependent on the method used in the request, for example:
     
     - GET an entity corresponding to the requested resource is sent in the response;
     - HEAD the entity-header fields corresponding to the requested resource are sent in the response without any message-body;
     - POST an entity describing or containing the result of the action;
     - TRACE an entity containing the request message as received by the end server.

     Standard response for successful HTTP requests. The actual response will depend on the request method used. In a GET request, the response will contain an entity corresponding to the requested resource. In a POST request the response will contain an entity describing or containing the result of the action.
     
     * General status code. Most common code used to indicate success.

     The request has been fulfilled and resulted in a new resource being created. The newly created resource can be referenced by the URI(s) returned in the entity of the response, with the most specific URI for the resource given by a Location header field. The response SHOULD include an entity containing a list of resource characteristics and location(s) from which the user or user agent can choose the one most appropriate. The entity format is specified by the media type given in the Content-Type header field. The origin server MUST create the resource before returning the 201 status code. If the action cannot be carried out immediately, the server SHOULD respond with 202 (Accepted) response instead.
     
     A 201 response MAY contain an ETag response header field indicating the current value of the entity tag for the requested variant just created, see section 14.19.

     If the client is a user agent, it SHOULD NOT change its document view from that which caused the request to be sent. This response is primarily intended to allow input for actions to take place without causing a change to the user agent's active document view, although any new or updated metainformation SHOULD be applied to the document currently in the user agent's active view.

     If the client has performed a conditional GET request and access is allowed, but the document has not been modified, the server SHOULD respond with this status code. The 304 response MUST NOT contain a message-body, and thus is always terminated by the first empty line after the header fields.
     
     The response MUST include the following header fields:
     
     - Date, unless its omission is required by section 14.18.1
     
     If a clockless origin server obeys these rules, and proxies and clients add their own Date to any response received without one (as already specified by [RFC 2068], section 14.19), caches will operate correctly.
     
     - ETag and/or Content-Location, if the header would have been sent in a 200 response to the same request
     - Expires, Cache-Control, and/or Vary, if the field-value might differ from that sent in any previous response for the same variant
     
     If the conditional GET used a strong cache validator (see section 13.3.3), the response SHOULD NOT include other entity-headers. Otherwise (i.e., the conditional GET used a weak validator), the response MUST NOT include other entity-headers; this prevents inconsistencies between cached entity-bodies and updated headers.
     
     If a 304 response indicates an entity not currently cached, then the cache MUST disregard the response and repeat the request without the conditional.
     
     If a cache uses a received 304 response to update a cache entry, the cache MUST update the entry to reflect any new field values given in the response.
     
     Wikipedia
     Indicates the resource has not been modified since last requested. Typically, the HTTP client provides a header like the If-Modified-Since header to provide a time against which to compare. Using this saves bandwidth and reprocessing on both the server and client, as only the header data must be sent and received in comparison to the entirety of the page being re-processed by the server, then sent again using more bandwidth of the server and client.
     
     * Used for conditional GET calls to reduce band-width usage. If used, must set the Date, Content-Location, ETag headers to what they would have been on a regular GET call. There must be no body on the response.

     The request requires user authentication. The response MUST include a WWW-Authenticate header field (section 14.47) containing a challenge applicable to the requested resource. The client MAY repeat the request with a suitable Authorization header field (section 14.8). If the request already included Authorization credentials, then the 401 response indicates that authorization has been refused for those credentials. If the 401 response contains the same challenge as the prior response, and the user agent has already attempted authentication at least once, then the user SHOULD be presented the entity that was given in the response, since that entity might include relevant diagnostic information. HTTP access authentication is explained in "HTTP Authentication: Basic and Digest Access Authentication".
     
     Wikipedia
     Similar to 403 Forbidden, but specifically for use when authentication is possible but has failed or not yet been provided.

If the server does not wish to make this information available to the client, the status code 404 (Not Found) can be used instead.

     The request was a legal request, but the server is refusing to respond to it. Unlike a 401 Unauthorized response, authenticating will make no difference.

This status code is commonly used when the server does not wish to reveal exactly why the request has been refused, or when no other response is applicable.

    /**
     The request could not be completed due to a conflict with the current state of the resource. This code is only allowed in situations where it is expected that the user might be able to resolve the conflict and resubmit the request. The response body SHOULD include enough information for the user to recognize the source of the conflict. Ideally, the response entity would include enough information for the user or user agent to fix the problem; however, that might not be possible and is not required.
     
     Conflicts are most likely to occur in response to a PUT request. For example, if versioning were being used and the entity being PUT included changes to a resource which conflict with those made by an earlier (third-party) request, the server might use the 409 response to indicate that it can't complete the request. In this case, the response entity would likely contain a list of the differences between the two versions in a format defined by the response Content-Type.
